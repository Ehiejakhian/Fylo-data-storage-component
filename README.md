## Meet Me
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!

## My process
After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS or Comic Relief as my font during design because it feels relaxing to my eyes and it helps me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Funny and weird, right?üòÅ

With SASS, I create mixins and partials to modularize my code. It helps me think and scroll through code with a simple mind.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to create tooltips for the first time. Using SCSS:


```scss
@media (min-width: $tablet) {
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  align-self: flex-end;

  &::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    border: 10px solid #fff;
    top: 100%;
    right: 0;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-color: #fff #fff $Blue-850 $Blue-850;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I had problems with scaling to meet the design. The font size, padding and widths didn't just add up for me. I would love to getv better at that and I would appreciate any help on that.

### Useful Resources

- [W3 school Tutorial | Tooltips](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp) - This helped me create the tooltip. W3 schools is an amazing platform that teaches you everything.

For now I don't have a website of my own, but I am working on having one soon. It's very important.
